It was warm enough for March in New York City, so I decided to go for long evening stroll. Besides seeing the usual pimps and hookers, wealthy spending their dollars, and all the other denizens, my main goal of mine was an old one -- to document the life of those who actually live in this place, who have no where else to go.

It was the night of Purim. I think Google educated me on this holy day. It was encouraging to see as I passed several synagogues, the poor being given all sort of pragmatic things: hygiene items, backpacks, blankets, etc. It's such a shame, but what else could be done to solve the problem of poverty? This is simply a finger in the dyke.

It was getting fairly cold as I walked trough the night. There was only one recycler I saw. He was well bundled, but probably ripe from digging in refuse bins all night. I kept my distance. He was, other than the groups I saw getting their Purim charity, about all the noticeable street persons out. Everyone else was partying, working, or both.

I decided I could take the cold by about 3 am, so decided to hit a popular train station. Sure enough, probably half the people where I waited for my train were getting out of the elements for the night. I didn't take any pictures. I had enough. One old man with a shopping cart filled with 'stuff' studied his Bible while standing in the center of the platform.

He had a religious slogan on both sides of his cart "Judgement is Coming".
