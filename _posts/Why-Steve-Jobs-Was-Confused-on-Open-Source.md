It's not often I speak with techies, even people who are leads in their respective teams who seem to have a bit of confusion about what open source is or how it relates to operating systems, especially vis-a-vis Android/Linux and iOS. The ignorance of what constitutes Open Source, especially when it comes to Apple, is astounding.

The late Steve Jobs in 2010 famously went off on Google about their 'disingenuous' open source project, Android. When pressed on what he meant by this, his only defense was that Android was 'fragmented', meaning that as criteria for NOT being open source. For real, Apple?

Jobs then went on to state that Windows was the most open source platform. When pressed on that, he backed off, but obviously sees open source being a monolithic code base controlled by a large corporation. If that is open source, then I am afraid I cannot lend my support to open source philosophies.

This is obviously wrong, but it stands to reason the confusion that many Apple acolytes I speak with have about the concept or where Apple or iOS sits in the whole spectrum.

In ad hoc response to this, I often hear that Android is not really Linux or open source either, like the ghost of Steve Jobs. This just is not true. While it is true that the Android OS forked briefly from the Linux code base, the two code bases are now firmly merged and separate forks in the future of the two code bases seems unlikely. 

Tizen, a new Linux-only competitor is out there. But the use of both Moz and Ubuntu of the Linux/Android code base in their Mobile OSes is a clear indication of Android's creds as an open source platform.

Bottom line: POSIX !== Open Source
