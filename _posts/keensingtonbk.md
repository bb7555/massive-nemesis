I'm just gonna let you know I was terrified  -- 900+ persons aged 4-11. 89% of them are on government assistance to eat and 95% are under threat of food insecurity. I had to help feed them.

It seemed like a bad dream, but it wasnt. It was quite real -- PS 179 in Brooklyn. Kensington Brooklyn, a place that is a predominantly residential area that consists of housing types that run the gamut from brick rowhouses to detached one-family Victorians to apartment buildings. Pre-war brick apartment buildings dominate the Ocean Parkway and Coney Island Avenue frontage, including many that operate as co-ops.  The average home price, accoding to Trulia.com, is $750k, and many homes in the area upon brief inspection of the site show dozens of homes listed for much more -- in the multi-millions of dollars.

Most of these children and families who attend school here are enrolled in SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), the federal program that provides food assistance to needy people, or, more commonly called <i>food stamps</i>. 

By the end of the month, most of the assistance has been used. During this time period, the Food Bank of NYC provides 35 pounds of food to each child at PS 179. This provides enough meals -- 25 meals on average -- to get them through until the first of the month, when the new dole of food stamps are issued.

The food pantry program at PS 179 is once a month. But it's a lot of food and packaging. During January's pantry event, it was frigid, so we only saw 300 children and their families: 

300 kids * 35 lbs. of food = 7000 lbs. or 3.5 tons of food. That's a lot of food and work, even it was a light month due to the weather. What's a heavy month?

So long story short, This is pretty much brazen propaganda for Food Bank NYC. Any and corporate sponsorship is greatly appreciated and thanked. And individual volunteerism is also good to. :-D
